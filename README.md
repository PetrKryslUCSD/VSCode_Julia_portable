# VSCode_Julia_portable

TLDR: Portable Julia running in VSCode. 

The userâ€™s system does not need to have Git installed: the portable version of
it is included. All the user needs to do is to double-click a batch file
(`DOUBLE_CLICK_ME.bat`): everything installs itself, and VS code pops up
preconfigured for work with Julia. 

Tested on Windows 11 64-bit systems.
